  - Need: System to track user's leaderboard rank changes
  - Trophies: Top Player (#1), Podium Finish (top 3), Top 10, Challenger, Multi-Mode Master

- ❌ **Game Timing**
  - Need: Track game start/end timestamps
  - Trophies: Fast Learner (<5 min), Speedrunner (<3 min), Time Attack Master

- ❌ **Accuracy Tracking**
  - Need: Per-game accuracy calculation

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

### Database Fields Added

```prisma
// User model trophy tracking fields
gamesPlayed          Int     @default(0)
gamesWon             Int     @default(0)
currentStreak        Int     @default(0)
bestStreak           Int     @default(0)
cardsGuessed         Int     @default(0)
sharesCount          Int     @default(0)
totalDonated         Int     @default(0)
highScore            Int     @default(0)
timesBeatenHighScore Int     @default(0)
uniqueSetsGuessed    String? // JSON array
```

### API Endpoints Created

- `GET /trophies` - Get all trophy definitions
- `GET /trophies/me` - Get user's unlocked trophies
- `POST /trophies/check` - Manually trigger trophy check
- `POST /users/share` - Track share action
- `POST /users/donation` - Record donation

### Automatic Tracking

After each game completion, the system automatically:

1. Updates all relevant user stats
2. Tracks unique sets from game cards
3. Checks for new high scores
4. Updates win streaks
5. Runs trophy checking logic
6. Awards newly unlocked trophies
7. Logs achievements to console

## 📝 Remaining Work Breakdown

### Easy (Can be done quickly)

None remaining - Priority 1 complete!

### Medium (Requires schema/logic changes)

1. **Per-Round Scores** (~2 hours)
   - Add `roundScores` JSON field to GameSession
   - Track scores per round in game logic
   - Update trophy checking for "Perfect Round"

2. **Card Rarity** (~3 hours)
   - Fetch rarity from TCGdex when loading cards
   - Add `rarityStats` JSON field to User
   - Track rarity counts per game
   - Implement rarity trophy checking

3. **Timing Data** (~3 hours)
   - Add timestamp tracking to rounds/guesses
   - Store timing data in GameSession
   - Implement speed trophy checking

### Complex (Requires new systems)

1. **Leaderboard Tracking** (~5 hours)
   - Build leaderboard position tracking system
   - Track rank changes over time
   - Implement leaderboard trophy logic

2. **Game Timing** (~2 hours)
   - Add game start/end timestamps
   - Calculate game duration
   - Implement timing-based trophies

3. **Advanced Accuracy** (~2 hours)
   - Calculate per-game accuracy
   - Track perfect games
   - Implement accuracy trophies

4. **Time-Based** (~2 hours)
   - Detect weekend games
   - Track games by day/time
   - Implement weekend warrior trophy

## 🚀 Next Steps

### If Continuing Implementation:

1. Add per-round score tracking (1 trophy)
2. Implement card rarity tracking (3 trophies)
3. Add timing data for speed trophies (2 trophies)
4. Build leaderboard system (5 trophies)
5. Implement remaining special trophies (4 trophies)

### If Stopping Here:

- **39/54 trophies (72%) are fully functional**
- All basic gameplay trophies work
- Advanced/complex trophies require additional infrastructure
- System is production-ready for core features
- Can be extended incrementally as needed

## 💡 Notes

- TypeScript errors about Prisma fields resolve after `npx prisma generate`
- All migrations have been created and applied
- Frontend is complete and displays all 54 trophies
- Trophy checking is automatic and performant
- Console logging helps with debugging trophy unlocks
- JSON fields used for flexible data storage (sets, rarities, etc.)
